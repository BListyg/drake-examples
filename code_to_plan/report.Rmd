## R Markdown

You can use a `knitr` report with code chunks to create a `drake` plan. Here is a target and its command.

```{r t}
t <- rnorm(10)
```

You can use various assignment operators.

```{r u}
u <<- rnorm(10)
```

Assignment operators can go either way.

```{r vw}
rnorm(10) -> v
rnorm(10) ->> w
```

You can assign triggers, etc. in the same way you would in `drake_plan()`.

```{r x}
x <- target(
  command = c((sqrt(5) + 1) / 2, (sqrt(5) - 1) / 2),
  trigger = trigger(condition = TRUE),
  timeout = 100
)
```

But each target can take only one expression as its command. Please enclose multiple lines in curly braces.

```{r yz}
y = {
  tmp <- 0
  for (i in 1:10){
    tmp <- tmp + w + x
  }
  tmp
}

{
  tmp <- 0
  for (i in 1:10){
    tmp <- tmp + x + y
  }
  tmp
} -> z
```

Unevaluated/inactive code chunks are ignored.

```{r end, eval = FALSE}
print("not run")
```
